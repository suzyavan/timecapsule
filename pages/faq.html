            <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
            <p>Our platform lets you create digital time capsules. You can securely upload photos, set a timer, and lock them away until the chosen time has passed. No peeking allowed!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How do I create a time capsule?</h2>
            <p>First, sign up for an account. Once you're in, you can upload your photos and set a timer—days, months, or even years. Once the timer starts, the capsule is sealed until time runs out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I open or view my photos before the timer ends?</h2>
            <p>Nope! That’s the whole magic of the time capsule. Once it’s locked, not even you can view it until the countdown finishes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Is my data secure?</h2>
            <p>Yes. All your uploads are stored securely with encryption. Only your account has access, and nothing is accessible until the set timer expires.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I delete a time capsule before the timer ends?</h2>
            <p>No, much like a time capsule, we believe that not being able to delete it mirrors the authentic experience of storing a time capsule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What file types are supported?</h2>
            <p>Currently, we support standard image formats: PNG, JPG, and JPEG. More formats may be added in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Is there a limit to how many photos I can store?</h2>
            <p>Actually, with the amount we are overseeing, we see that you can share as much as your heart's desire!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What if I forget my login or password?</h2>
            <p>No worries! You can reset your password via the login page. If you need help, our support team is just a click away.</p>
