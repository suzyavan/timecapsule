        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>You ever find some news report of a time capsule that was tossed into a hole 50 or even 100 years ago. 
            Although it may seem like those times might be over, it can still be possible with the Time Capsule. 
            The Time Capsule was designed with the idea of allowing users to implement photos with family, friends, or adventures into a safe file. 
            This allows the user to set a specific date into the system to make sure that the file will not be unlocked until the set date is reached. 
            We hope to bring users into a website they can trust with these delicate photos and for allowing family from the future to enjoy things from the past.</p>
